# stm32-midi-usb
Basic and lightweight (5KB) USB MIDI controller sample for stm32f103c6t6 MCU.

The code is based on [COKPOWEHEU]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/COKPOWEHEU/usb))'s USB samples. It uses CMSIS library only, so despite the CMSIS library is a bit harder to understand than HAL, it is much easier to realize how the code works and launch it

Hardware: 
Bluepill board with STM32F103C6T6.
